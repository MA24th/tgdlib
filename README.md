## Getting Started

This framework is tested with:

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8

There are two ways to install the package:

* Installation using pip (a Python package manager):

```bash
pip install tgdlib
```

* Installation from source (requires git):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ma24th/tgdlib.git
cd tgdlib
python setup.py install
```

It is generally recommended to use the first option.

*While the framework is production-ready, 
it is still under development and it has regular updates, 
do not forget to update it regularly by calling `pip install tgdlib --upgrade`*
